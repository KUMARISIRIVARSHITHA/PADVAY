# PADVAY
PADVAY is a online placement interaction portal. It acts like a platform where job seekers and recruiters meet. Our basic idea is that the recruiters can post the job offers in the website only when recruiters request the superadmin for permission to post the offers The superadmin supervises the overall process on this website. After superadmin validates their data. Then, job seekers can simply register themselves with the website by filling their details and applying for job offers.
